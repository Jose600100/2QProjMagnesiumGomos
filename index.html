      <h1>WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANIME!</h1>
      <p>The world of Anime is vast and full of wonders, and it’s easy to get lost in it. Not everyones’ journey will be the same, but I have generalized the entire thing into 5 parts. So whether you are a young weeblet just getting started, or a seasoned veteran reminiscing of the past, I think that you will find something interesting here.</p>

      <a href="htdocs/page1.html"> Starting Out </a>
      <p> Our story has to start somewhere, as even the tallest trees start out as little seeds. Here, the preconceived notions of Anime, the terms used around the community, as well as some of the more popular genres will be discussed, as we begin our journey through the world of anime. </p>

        <p>Often called the “Golden Age” of a weeb’s anime journey, this is where the possibilities start to seem endless. Everywhere you look, there’s always something more waiting to be found. Communities and References! Manga and Light Novels! Here, the sky's the limit, so just reach out and grab it!</p>

				<a href="htdocs/page3.html"> Losing Steam</a>
        <p>For every high, there is a low. Soon, even the constant stream of new anime will start to get stale. Not many people make it past this phase, with others taking years just to get this far. When the excitement dies down and the dust settles, will you still be able to call yourself a weeb?</p>

				<a href="htdocs/page4.html"> A Changed Weeb</a>
        <p>This is the end of the road. Very few people manage to reach this phase on their anime journey. Once you get this far, there is no turning back. Do you have what it takes to be called a person of culture?</p>
