    <h1>Losing Steam</h1>
    <p>For every high, there is a low. Soon, even the constant stream of new anime will start to get stale. Not many people make it past this phase, with others taking years just to get this far. When the excitement dies down and the dust settles, will you still be able to call yourself a weeb?</p>

      <h1>Not Enough Time</h1>
      <p>Ironically, one of Anime’s main selling points could also be a major downside. While your time to watch anime is finite daily, and can even lessen as time passes, the number of Anime will only go up. This is sometimes referred to as the <i>“oversaturation”</i> of Anime, and is one of the reasons why you could stop watching anime.</p>
      <h2>Increase of Standards and Expectations</h2>
      <p>Because there are so many shows, and so little time to watch them, you start to increase your standards of what you are willing to watch. Because of this, your view of anime will shift over time. You might start to limit yourself to shows that are amazing masterpieces. This might cause you to set the bar impossibly high, and while at first it may not be a problem, the World of Anime is merely vast, not infinite.</p>

      <h1>Running out of Anime</h1>
      <p>Now, you find yourself running out of anime to watch. This won’t happen for a while into your Anime career, but it will happen. Perhaps it is due to you having watched incredible show after show when you first started, and now your standards are too high. Perhaps it was due to another reason entirely. Whatever the case, The magic bag of Anime is starting to run low, and that is a problem.</p>
      <h2>No more Anime</h2>
      <p>As you continue to watch more and more anime, you might hit a point where you think that there is no more anime for you to watch. Despite the multitude of shows that you haven’t watched yet, you do not want to watch any of them. You have exhausted all your other options, and the only thing you can do now is to wait for a new season of anime.</p>

      <h2>Waiting for the New Season </h2>
      <p>However, waiting for a new season isn’t always an option. The time between each season is at least 3 months, and sometimes even more. Even if you are able to wait though those agonizing days, it’s not always a guarantee that the next batch of Anime will have something that you enjoy. The reason why those amazing Anime are considered special is because they are very rare, and if you limit yourself to only watching them, you will be left wanting for more.<p>
      <h2>“Not as good as before” </h2>
      <p>This drought of new Anime can lead you to thinking that Anime is “not as good as it was before”. You remember a time when there was so much anime to watch, with each new series making you wish for much more. Now, you can’t even bring yourself to watch a single episode of the newer shows. Everything feels like copies of each other and nothing seems original anymore.</p> 
      <p>This mindset is one of the biggest contributors to falling out with anime. <p>

      <h1>Falling out with the community</h1>
      <p>Another deciding factor is the community. Now that the honeymoon period is over, you might start to see your fellow community members in a different light.</p>

      <h2>Toxic Fans</h2>
      <p>The fans would be the first signs of trouble. The only thing connecting you and them is your love and enjoyment of a certain series, other than that you all come from different walks of life. While it is admirable that Anime can bring these different people together, their differences can sometimes lead to conflict within the groups themselves. Beyond these cultural and regional differences, there are also some baffling things that are considered normal in the community, but in reality are unhealthy and <b>toxic</b> when viewed objectively. You might begin to consider your fellow weebs as annoying, irritating, or even <i>cringe</i>.</p>
      <h2>“I can’t keep up” </h2>
      <p>Your view on Anime being worse nowadays can also separate you more from the community. As a whole, the community will move on to the new currently airing shows, and they will be major talking points. If you are unfamiliar with these new shows, then you might find yourself unable to keep up with them, thus further distancing you from them.</p> 
      <p>These things can put you off from interacting with the community, and can serve to further distance yourself from Anime as a whole.</p>

      <h1>A Break from Anime</h1>
      <p>All these factors lead to you losing your enjoyment of Anime. The journey is no longer fun and exciting, and its feels more like a burden than an adventure to continue on it. This leads to only one answer: You need to take a break</p>
      <p>Who knows how long the break will last. The break might even last indefinitely for some. However, if you decide that even after seeing the negative side of the Anime world, you still want to continue your journey, then you will be back someday.</p>
