    <h1>A Changed Weeb</h1>
    <p>This is the end of the road. Very few people manage to reach this phase on their anime journey. Once you get this far, there is no turning back. Do you have what it takes to be called a person of culture?</p>

      <h1>Rekindling of Love for Anime</h1>
      <p>Welcome back. To reach this part of your journey you would have gone through the journey of a lifetime, and even after everything that has happened, both good and bad, you still want to watch anime. </p>
      <h2>The Catalyst</h2>
      <p>A number of things can act as a catalyst to return.</p>
      <p>These things can act as a catalyst, but if you don’t like Anime, then they are basically useless. They can act as the initial spark, but if there isn’t fuel already present, then there will be no fire. To come back to the world of Anime, you would have to still enjoy the medium, even after everything.</p>
      <p>Once you do return, then things really start to get going once more.</p>
      <h2> Re-expansion of Tastes and Interests</h2>
      <p>Of course, you won’t come back guns blazing. You will most likely start small, watching the same genres you used to watch. You might revisit your favorite Anime for nostalgia. Or maybe you use this opportunity to start fresh. Perhaps the break has changed your tastes, and you want to try a new genre of Anime.</p>
      <h2> Lowering of Expectations</h2>
      <p>Speaking of changes, another important change you need to do is to lower your expectations of Anime. If you aren’t able to lower your expectations of Anime, then your return to Anime won’t last forever. Not every show can be a masterpiece, and you have to learn to enjoy the other good shows for what they are, cliches and sappiness included.</p>
      <h2>Reality Settling In</h2>

      </aside>
      <p>This is one of the realizations that will happen on this leg of Anime journey. Another one is that time is finite, but is not too short either. You won’t have enough time to watch every single Anime, but you still have enough time to watch some of them. Don’t be too scared to watch even the not so highly rated ones. You never know when you'll find a diamond in the rough.</p>     
      <h2>Catching up with the community </h2>
      <p>Another thing that you need to do is catch up with the community. You are more mature now, and despite the fact that community can be childish and toxic at times, you shouldn’t be alone in this journey. If you want advice on what to do with the community, I think you should just try as much as possible <i>to avoid the people that you do not like</i>. Another upside with the size of the community is that doing this isn’t as hard as in other communities.</p>

      <h1>Outlook on Anime as a Whole</h1>
      <p>These changes on your journey will also start to change your outlook on Anime as a whole. This is “the final stretch” of your journey, so it is imperative that you should understand what Anime is. At this point, you are “old” enough to be considered as a veteran, especially to the weeblets. It is your duty to be able to guide them properly.</p>
      <h2>Outlook on Anime as a Whole </h2>
      <p>These changes on your journey will also start to change your outlook on Anime as a whole. This is “the final stretch” of your journey, so it is imperative that you should understand what Anime is. At this point, you are “old” enough to be considered as a veteran, especially to the weeblets. It is your duty to be able to guide them properly.</p>
      <h2>A Step Back</h2>
      <p>Let us take a moment to step back and take a look at Anime as a whole. I know it sounds cheesy, but your view of Anime should have changed over time. To everyone, Anime is different. To some, it is art, to others, a form of entertainment. Everyone has a different perspective on what Anime is, and at this point, you need to know what yours is.</p>
      <h2>Now I know</h2>
      <p>The phrase “Now I Know” is also very cheesy, but helps to visualize the differences and changes between weebs on their journey in the World of Anime. These differences show your growth as a weeb, and you can visibly see your progression through these changes. There are things you know now that you would not have known as a weeblet. But there are also things that even you still don’t know about.</p>
      <h2>The Vastness of Anime</h2>
      <p>That is the beautiful thing about the world of Anime. You can watch show after show, season after season for years and years and still there will be things that you have never seen before. There will always be things that you don’t know, and that’s okay. It's quite literally a whole new world to explore, and there is always something for everyone. It is not infinite, no. But it is vast enough to fit all kinds of people, including you. </p>
      <h2>Becoming a Proper Veteran</h2>
      <aside>
       <img src="../Images/Fate2.png" id="WImageR" title="Taken from pinterest.com" alt="A screenshot from Fate Stay/Night UBW" >     
      <p>It is also at this stage where you can become a proper veteran. Of course, people could have referred to you as a veteran even during your Ani-mania phase. But the break and subsequent return has cemented you as a true veteran. And your duty as a veteran is to guide new Anime watchers and weeblets on their journey through the world you have called home. </p>
      <p>There is really no right or wrong here, even if you can make a few mistakes along the way. All you have to do is to show them the world that you have fallen in love with and enjoyed, just like how you were initially guided when you were once starting out. </p>
      <p>By helping the new generation along, you continue the cycle of Anime fans. The new weeblets will someday grow into veterans themselves, and will soon guide the newer generations, who will then become veterans themselves, and so on. This means that our beloved world of Anime will never truly die, as long as there are still those of us who truly love and support it.</p>

      <h1>What Comes Next</h1>
      <p>Anime is just like any other hobby/interest. It is neither a beautiful utopia nor a depraved hell. It is as beautiful as it is toxic, and you have to learn how to see it for what it really is. That is the most important lesson you need to learn on your journey through the world of Anime. </p>
      <p>At this point, whether you decide to continue on this adventure as a veteran guiding and helping others on this journey, or decide to walk away, having lived a lifetime in this world, to pursue other journeys, I do not mind. I have shown you a generalization of one's journey into Anime, based almost entirely on my own experiences. Perhaps I have been spot on, or perhaps I was wrong entirely, I do not know.</p>
      <p>To me, the world of Anime is a wonderful world, even with all its problems and shortcomings. Through my recounting of the journey, I hope that you can see it too. </p>
