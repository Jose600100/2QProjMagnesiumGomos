      <h1>Picking Up Steam</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>As you start watching more and more Anime, you begin to be aware of the limits, or rather the lack of limits, that the world of Anime has to offer. It is a seemingly endless rabbit hole, and the more you keep watching, the more you get sucked in. It is an all you can eat buffet, and you are (quite literally) starving for more.</p>

      <h2>Binge Watching and Daily Multiple Seasons</h2>
      <p>Time itself seems to extend and contract just to allow you to watch more Anime. As you press onward on this journey, you start to practice and master the art of “Binge Watching”. Binge Watching is when you decide to watch a whole season's worth of Anime in one sitting. Usually, binge watching doesn’t even start from a willingness to binge watch. Instead, while watching Anime, you then lose track of time. Until suddenly you find yourself having finished watching a season’s worth of episodes in the span of a few hours. </p>

      </aside>
      <p>The binge watching will only get worse from here on out. Though I call it an art, it can sometimes act like a sickness. While you find that the number of episodes that you can watch in a day increases as time passes, you also start to feel your sense of time slipping. Days turn to nights and back to days without you even noticing. <b>Self Control</b> like most aspects of life, is essential to keeping you on track. Though it is not something that even the most veteran of weebs have under control.</p>

      <h2>“Anitube” and Other External Media </h2>
      <p>It is at this part of your journey that you start to be aware of <b>“Anitube”</b>. </p>
      <p>Anitube is a contraction of the words <i>Anime</i> and <i>Youtube</i>, and refers to the portion of youtube that focuses primarily on Anime. Videos all about your favorite Anime can be found here. Theories, discussions, reviews, music videos, and even parodies can be found here, and there are many similar forms of media on the other major social media platforms. These will serve as your first glimpse into the incredible world of Anime and communities and fandoms, which are sometimes even bigger than the Anime themselves. </p>

      <h1>Discovery of “Seasonal Anime” </h1>
      <p>Along the way, you will find out about <i>“Seasonal Anime”</i>. This is a turning point in one’s Anime journey, and once you learn about it, you will find that you truly have fallen deep into the rabbit hole. </p>
      <p>The term itself refers to how new Anime is released. They are released in batches, corresponding to the 4 seasons found in non-tropical countries. From the start of the year to the last, it goes: Winter(Jan-March), Spring(April-June), Summer(July-Sept) and Fall(Oct-Dec). Each season of Anime lasts 3 months or about 12 weeks, as most of the time new episodes are released each week. When referring to a specific season, you first say the name of the season, followed by the year, i.e Summer 2020, Fall 2021, Winter 2022. The number of new Anime differs per season, but has been slowly increasing as time goes by. </p>
      <p>With a catalogue of old Anime spanning decades, and with new ones being released every few months, it is quite easy to find yourself swamped by the sheer volume of them all. This has lead to the expression: <b>”Too Much Anime”</b></p>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section>
      <h2>“Too Much Anime”</h2>
      <p> Sometimes having so much on your plate makes you less willing to eat. The same is true for Anime. The over-abundance of them could be very overwhelming for some newer weebs, but for others, it could be taken as an invitation to go even further and explore more.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Expansion of Taste and Development of Favorite Genres/Anime</h2>
      <p> At this point, you have seen firsthand what is waiting for you out there. Here, you should’ve already expanded your <i>“taste”</i> in what genres you like/enjoy. It's just like any other media, where different people will have different interests. As you continue your journey, your favorite genres will shift and expand. There will be those shows that really capture your heart, and will remain your favorite shows for the rest of your life.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Discovery of Manga, Light Novels, and other anime-related media </h2>
      <p>These shows that you enjoy could also be a gateway to another aspect of your Anime journey, that being Manga and Light Novels. Some Anime that you enjoy might not have finished the entire story, and maybe there is no hope for another season of the show. Or perhaps the next season of a show is taking a very long time to release. Or maybe the Anime did not do a good job of telling the story, but felt that there was potential. Whatever your reason may be, you will have found yourself looking for the source material, that most of the time being <b>Manga</b> and <b>Light Novels</b></p>

      </aside>
      <p>Manga is basically the Japanese counterpart of comic books, with the main difference being that it is in black and white, and you read each page right to left. Light Novels(LN), on the other hand, are just books, with each series usually having multiple volumes. Most Anime are adaptations of series that were initially in Manga or Light Novel form. This means that while some shows are airing, their manga or LN counterparts would have already finished. This also means that while manga and LNs can be used to complete the story of an Incomplete Anime adaptation, you can also just read the source material without having seen the anime.</p> 
      <p>I know some people who prefer doing this, as it allows you to read at your own pace, and experience the series the way it was originally written. The Anime couldn’t have covered everything, so these alternatives are good when you want to experience more from the series/franchise. Games and spin-offs are also a good way to experience more from your favorite stories. </p>
      <h2>Discovery of Anime-based Communities </h2>
      <p>However, getting to these stories in the first place is a hard task. The biggest hurdle that you have to pass on your anime journey is the <i>language barrier</i>. As you should know by now, Anime is in <b>Japanese</b>. So unless you are lucky enough to know Japanese yourself, most Anime will be unavailable to you. That is why Anime-based communities are very important. They basically act like a safe haven during your journey. Perhaps you have questions about the series, or maybe you are looking for translated copies. These communities have you covered. When the original creators are in a faraway land separated by a language barrier, it is only natural that its fans group together to fend for themselves. </p>

      <h1>Golden Era</h1>
      <p>All of these factors combine to create the “Golden Era” of your Anime journey. This is the period where you will experience the highest of highs, with hardly any drawbacks. Everything is still new and fresh, and the community is welcoming and very helpful. It almost seems too good to be true, right?</p>
      <h2>Becoming a True Weeb</h2>
      <aside>
      <img src="../Images/AOT1.jpg" id="AImageR" title="Taken from youtube.com" alt="A screenshot from Attack On Titan" >
      </aside>
      <p>At this point, you are more than welcome to start calling yourself a weeb. You are familiar with the concepts, you watch a lot of Anime Manga, and Light Novels, and you know other people with similar interests. Most people would consider you a weeb. And in some cases, you probably are.</p>
      <p>But this is still the <i>“Honeymoon Phase”</i>. What happens when the excitement finally dies down, and you start to see the cracks. At this point you have primarily been exposed to the amazing side of the world of anime, so when you finally see its other side, can you still call yourself a weeb?</p>
      <p>What happens when you finally start <a href="../htdocs/page3.html">losing steam</a>?</p>
